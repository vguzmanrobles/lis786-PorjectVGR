This is an example of a file written in [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/). Notice how
this file lacks the normal HTML tags you may be used to seeing on website source code. Instead there is a simple syntax for applying most of the basic HTML formatting we use every day.

## This is what an h2 element looks like in Markdown

Paragraphs are just text without `<p>` tags. Take a look at my unordered (bulleted) list below:

- list item one
- list item two
- list item three

And here's an ordered (numbered) list:

1. List item one
1. list item two
1. list item three

(You can use any number and the script will convert the numbers to the correct ordering.)
